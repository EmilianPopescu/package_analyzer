For the output from yarn list --json > dependencies.json:
Use this analyzer when the yarn list --json command works correctly for your project.

For the output from script.py:
Use this if yarn list --json > dependencies.json doesnâ€™t work for your project.

In that case, just add your yarn.lock file to the folder and run script.py. This script will process and format all of your dependencies into a dependencies.json file. After that, run opackage.2.
